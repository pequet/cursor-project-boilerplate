# 295: File Preservation Standard

## CRITICAL: NEVER DELETE FILES

- **NEVER delete files under ANY circumstances.** This means you MUST NOT use the `rm` command EVER.
- Files contain critical information and history that must be preserved.
- Deleting files makes it impossible to review previous versions and breaks links.

## File Handling Guidelines:

### For Files No Longer Needed:
- NEVER delete them.
- **Move** files to the root `archives/` directory using the `mv` command.
- Example: `mv docs/old-feature.md archives/docs/old-feature.md`.
- Preserve the original file structure within the Archives folder only when appropriate.
- Add a note in the frontmatter explaining why it was archived if possible.

## Technical Implementation:
- Use proper file system operations that preserve file identifiers.
- Document any file movements or status changes in the appropriate logs.
- Check for and update any links to moved files.

## Rationale:
- Preserves complete history and context.
- Maintains link integrity.
- Allows for retrieval of previous content when needed.
- Ensures information is never permanently lost.
