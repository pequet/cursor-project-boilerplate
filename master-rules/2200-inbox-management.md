# Inbox Management Directives

## Input Processing (Adding to Inbox)

- **USE** timestamp-based naming: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_descriptive-name.md`.
- **APPLY** all required frontmatter fields correctly.
- **MAINTAIN** atomicity of insights in each file.
- **PROCESS** conversational transcripts systematically and sequentially, without echoing the source.

## Content Processing (Working with Inbox)

- **FOLLOW** the Insight Cultivation and Inbox Management guides for processing paths.
- **ENSURE** all content has a clear conceptual foundation, with technical details included only when relevant and valuable.
- **STRUCTURE** content with clear, atomic insights and provide source context where applicable.
